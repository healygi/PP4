## Existing Features

   - Featured on every page this is a simple navigation bar. It is fully responsive and includes links to Home, Register and Login. It is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation unless the user logs in then obviously the 'register' link disappears. 
   - If the user is viewing the site a phone or tablet - the navigation becomes a simple burger menu which pops down with the nav links and logo. This allows for easy flow navigation. 
   - The logo 'Healys Health' is also a clickable link to the home page. This allows for easy navigation when the user views the site on a mobile or tablet device.

## Features Left to Implement

I would like my blog site to be a page within a larger website. The project I wanted to create was too far out of scope for my PP4. I would like to implent the following to create a larger functioning website for a nutritional therapist. 

- Booking System

  - I would like to implement a booking system so that the users of the site could book in a session with the site owner (aka a nutritionist). 
  - I would like to implement the ability for the site owner to provide the user with feedback and homework after a one to one session. 

- Testimonials

  - I would like to create a review page so the user can leave testimonials on their experience and journey with Healys Health. 
  - I would like the user to be able to review their experience with the nutritionist and if they would recommend. 

- About 

  - I would like to create an about page to inform users about the nutritionist - her education, experience and qualifications in the sector of health and nutritional therapy. 

- Contact 

  - I would like like to implement a contact page so that users can contact the site owner whether on site, phone, email or social media. 
  - The booking system would be implemented on this page. 

- Footer

  - I would like the footer to include location and contact information.
